# Game of Life

I'm planning to build the game of life application. I have tried it twice before, in Java and then in Golang. This time I plan to try it in TypeScript and also see a visual representation of it ;) :D

The plan is to create an engine first, kind of like a game engine, which knows how the game of life works. And then create a UI separately :)

I have to see how to import the engine in the UI project. As a external npm package by publishing it on npm registry or by importing it locally. However this is just an experiment, so I'll start small I guess.

For the engine and UI - I plan to use TypeScript. For UI - I plan to use React with TypeScript

I wanted to create the engine separately so that the UI can be changed with ease later or more UIs can be created with same engine behind the scenes.

Surely many would have built this. I have also seen articles about the same when I wanted to check who has done it before. I wasn't surprised to see many doing it.

I'm just doing this for fun and to see visually how good it looks as previously I had only create a simple command line interface UI which simply showed which cells are alive and which cells are not alive.

I recently learned a lot in React and TypeScript. I figured I could put some skills to use and write some nice code with tests and see how to build this beautiful system iteratively :)
